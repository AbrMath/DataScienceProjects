## Overview

In this repository, you will find the code to various projects I have been working on or I am still in the process of developing. The majority of the projects are accompanied by a Medium blog posts at [medium.com/@tuandoan.nguyen](https://medium.com/@tuandoan.nguyen). I published almost exclusively on Towards Data Science publication through Medium's Partnership program so please check out these articles as a way to support me and my future projects. Alternatively, you can also find my blog posts at my personal website [Tuan Doan](https://tuangauss.github.io/).

My interests lie in the intersection of statistical techniques, data visualization and sports (especially football). All the codes are written entirely in Python or R. I used the two languages almost interchangebly. It really boils down to how a specific functionality in need is supported (scraping in Python and data processing with dplyr piping in R).

### The statistics of modern football:
Here are a number of projects that explore the intricate statistical aspect of the Beautiful Game

- [Empirical Bayes and penalty taking ability](https://towardsdatascience.com/men-of-steel-finding-the-best-penalty-takers-with-empirical-bayes-estimation-aa0e126fb08b)
- [Poisson process and match prediction](https://towardsdatascience.com/o-jogo-bonito-predicting-the-premier-league-with-a-random-model-1b02fa3a7e5a) - Here we learn about the Poisson process and how a random model outperforms football experts with its prediction.
- [The mathematics of football betting strategies](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-big-bucks-with-a-data-driven-sports-betting-strategy-6c21a6869171) - With the Poisson model and some additional help from mathematical research, can we beat the bookies?
- [Fisher vs Neyman-Person debate and Paul the Octopus](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-can-an-octopus-tell-us-about-the-biggest-debate-in-statistical-theory-f017295d781f) - We went over the theory (or many theories) of hypothesis testings and see how they apply to the psychic ability of Paul the Octopus.
